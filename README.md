Tasks
I attempted the Fullstack Assignment.

I was able to complete the frontend assignment, and finish all of the backend assignments.
Only part I couldnt do was getting the Web Socket up and running, therefore i couldnt finish the routes that require websocket.

Dependencies that I used

Challenges Faced and Overcoming Them
One of the main challenges was visualizing the user flow and determining the optimal user experience. By creating a schema and flowchart (available in the public folder of the GitHub repository), I was able to map out the user journey and clarify feature requirements. This process provided a clear direction for development, facilitating smoother implementation of features and functionality.

How to get it running

A. Running it locally

1. Clone the repository from GitHub: git clone <repository-url>
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd into newly created folder
   3.Install dependencies: npm install
   4.On 1 terminal, Start the backend server: npm run dev:backend
   5.On another terminal, Start the frontend development server: npm run dev:frontend
   6.Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

B. Use the Website
